Rails Foundation
========================

This app includes a storefront generated with Rails that is then styled using Zurb Foundation based on RailsCast #417. An about us section was added to the right of the store that resizes itself depending on the window size.  The creating an item interface was fleshed out using Zurb styling as well adding tags and a field to the display.
